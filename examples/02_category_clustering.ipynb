    "# Finding Key Drivers\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have our data nicely broken down, we might want a way to automatically detect the major driving factors. This is often a difficult task, as the biggest factors won't always be the most obvious. This search is skewed by the dimensions we choose to look at, and the way we choose to look at them. For example, if you go looking through age-based factors, your conclusions will be skewed to look at age as a major factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, most analysts I've worked with (myself included!) tend to take a \"kitchen sink\" approach when searching for factors. Naturally, this search is not completely blind, and is usually guided by some domain knowledge. However, the goal is to cast a wide net and see what sticks, and try to disprove the obvious hypotheses. This search is slow and tedious, and often involves a lot of manual work. It also easily misses out on interactions between factors, and can be skewed by the order in which factors are considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accelerate this manual work, it's tempting to look at effects as driven by \"individual factors\". Statistcal approaches work well here, and machine learning approaches such as boosted trees are exceptionally useful for detecting interactions between factors, even in high dimensions. Ignore issues with interpretability for a moment, as tools like Shap can be (ab)used to get a good proxy for contribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest issue here is that effects may be driven not just by the contributions of individuals, but also by the size of their demographic. Both machine learning and statistical methods work with averages, but sums pay your salary. In physics terms, we're less interested in the \"temperature\" of a group of particles, and more interested in the \"heat\" of the group. For example, a small group of people with a high spend may have a smaller effect on overall profit than a large group of people with a low average spend. Accordingly, if we want to \"double down on success\", our efforts to drive incremental revenue may be best focused in the latter group!\n",
    "\n",
    "To date, the only method I've found that can handle consistently getting at the core drivers of a problem is the \"key drivers\" method implemented in this package. This process works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Group your data by the dimensions you're interested in. For each group, calculate the sum of the target KPI.\n",
    "1. Declare some threshold for the minimum impact you're interested in. This could be a percentage of the total, or a fixed value. I normally use a percentage of the total, so I divide the total KPI by the mean.\n",
    "1. Find all contributions from all columns with an effect greater than the threshold ordered by the smallest membership. This represents the smallest groups with an outsized effect on the target KPI, so include them before bigger groups.\n",
    "1. This one's important: _remove the observations that are in this group from the data_. This is the key step that allows us to find the next biggest driver.\n",
    "1. Assuming you have $n$ columns in the previous step. Repeat steps 3-4 on combinations of $n-1$ columns.\n",
    "1. Repeat step 5 until you're working with individual columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you might observe that this process is...somewhat inefficient. I agree. And if you were working with thousands of columns...well, you'd be in trouble. However, this process is the only one I've found that consistently gets at the core drivers of a problem. If you know of a better one, and I'd be willing to bet that there are MANY people out there who know more about this stuff than me, please let me know!\n",
    "\n",
    "For the rest of us, this approach is also great way to get a sense of the interactions between factors as part of an EDA. Besides, if you're putting in 1000 columns, you'd probably struggle to interpret the results for business stakeholders anyway. Have a chat to your counterparts about likely factors and try get that kitchen sink down from the size of a swimming pool to...uh...a kitchen sink.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "The function assumes you can neatly sum all variables, and so have denominated all factors in your key KPI. (If this seems like magic, check the last notebook!) For funsies, we're going to concentrate on the profit gain from `items_per_transaction` and `income_per_item`. There are many other factors that you could care about given your context (see [the following article](https://commoncog.com/the-amazon-weekly-business-review/)) but we're going to assume that these two are the most important for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll set the target number of factors to 10; this means we're hunting for groupings that comprise 10% or greater of total profit. We can tweak both the target number of factors and the threshold independently, but I've found that the target number of factors is the most important parameter to tweak."
